# 02 — Linux File Permissions (rwx + chmod)

## Goal (plain English)
Show how Linux permissions control who can read/write/execute a file.

## What I did
- Created a test file and checked its permissions (`ls -l`)
- Restricted the file to owner-only access (`chmod 600`)
- Verified permissions and metadata (`stat`)
- Saved outputs in `captures/` as evidence

## What I observed / how to explain it
- `ls -l` shows Linux permissions in the format: `-rwxrwxrwx` (file type + permissions)
- Permissions are split into 3 groups:
  - Owner (you)
  - Group
  - Others (everyone else)
- Each group can have:
  - `r` (read), `w` (write), `x` (execute)
- After running `chmod 600 secret.txt`, the file became owner-only:
  - Owner can read/write
  - Group and Others have no access
- `stat` confirms the numeric permission mode (like `0600`) and shows owner + timestamps

## Evidence I saved (portfolio-friendly)
- Notes: `notes/02_files_permissions.md`
- Captures: `captures/02_*`
- Screenshot (optional): `screenshots/02_permissions_output.png`

## Why this matters (interview-ready)
“Linux permissions are a foundational access control. I used `ls -l`, `chmod`, and `stat` to show least privilege in action and how file access is enforced at the OS level.”tz
