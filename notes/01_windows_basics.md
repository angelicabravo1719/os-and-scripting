\# 01 — Windows Basics (Command Line)



\## Goal 

Learn how to navigate folders, list files, and understand where you are on the system using the command line.



\## Why this matters

Security analysts and admins use command line constantly to:

\- Investigate incidents (find files, check logs)

\- Confirm what’s running / where files live

\- Automate repeat tasks



\## What I did

1\) Checked my current directory (where I am)

2\) Listed files/folders

3\) Navigated into and out of directories

4\) Created folders for this repo



\## Commands I used

```powershell

dir

cd ..

cd <folder>

mkdir <name>
